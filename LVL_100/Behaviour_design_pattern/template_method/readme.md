# Template Method Design Pattern in JavaScript

## Overview

The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall structure. This pattern promotes code reuse and facilitates the implementation of variations of an algorithm.

In this example, we have implemented the Template Method pattern to create analog and digital watches. Both types of watches share the same algorithm for displaying time but implement the display method differently.

## Usage

### Running the Code

To run the provided JavaScript code, you can execute it in a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js or in a browser environment. Each watch type (analog and digital) is instantiated and its `showTime()` method is called to demonstrate how each watch displays the time.


## Implementation Details

- The `Watch` class serves as the abstract template, defining the `showTime()` method and abstract methods for starting, displaying, and stopping the watch.
- Concrete subclasses `AnalogWatch` and `DigitalWatch` extend the `Watch` class and implement their specific behavior for starting, displaying, and stopping the watch.

## Benefits

- Encapsulates the algorithm in a superclass, making it easier to maintain and reuse.
- Allows subclasses to provide custom implementations for specific steps of the algorithm without altering its structure.
- Promotes consistency and reduces code duplication by enforcing a common algorithmic structure.

## Conclusion

The Template Method pattern is useful when you have algorithms with a fixed structure but variable implementation details. By defining a template method in a superclass, you can provide a framework for subclasses to customize behavior while maintaining overall consistency.

```javascript
// Client code
const analogWatch = new AnalogWatch();
const digitalWatch = new DigitalWatch();

console.log('Using analog watch:');
analogWatch.showTime();

console.log('\nUsing digital watch:');
digitalWatch.showTime();
