# Mediator Design Pattern

## Definition 
The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by introducing a central component (the mediator) that encapsulates the communication logic between these objects. This pattern is especially useful when you have a system with many interacting objects, and you want to avoid the complexity of direct communication between them.

## Overview

The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by introducing a central component (the mediator) that encapsulates the communication logic between these objects.

## Components

- **Mediator**: Defines the interface for communication between the objects and encapsulates the communication logic.
  
- **Colleague**: Objects that interact with each other through the mediator. They are typically decoupled from each other.
