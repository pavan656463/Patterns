# Observer Design Pattern

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object, known as the subject, to maintain a list of its dependents, called observers, and notify them of any changes in its state. This pattern is useful when you need to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, where multiple objects need to be updated when the state of one object changes.


### Participants

- **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers, and provides methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
- **ConcreteSubject**: Implements the Subject interface. It tracks its observers and notifies them of any state changes.
- **Observer**: Defines an interface for objects that should be notified of changes in the subject's state.
- **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the Observer interface. It defines the actions to be taken when notified by the subject.

## When to Use the Observer Pattern

- When changes to one object require changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed.
- When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.
- When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other. Encapsulating these aspects in separate objects allows them to vary independently.
