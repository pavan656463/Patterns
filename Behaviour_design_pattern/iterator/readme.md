# Iterator Design Pattern

## Intent
The Iterator Design Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It separates the responsibility of accessing and traversing the elements from the container, making the container simpler and more focused on its main purpose.

## Problem
When you have a collection (like a list or a set) and you want to traverse through its elements, you typically have to expose the internal structure of the collection. This can lead to issues like tightly coupled code, violating encapsulation, and difficulty in switching between different collection implementations.

## Solution
The Iterator pattern solves this problem by defining an interface for accessing the elements of the collection, without exposing its underlying representation. It provides a way to iterate over a collection of objects in a consistent manner, regardless of its implementation.

## Structure
- **Iterator**: Defines the interface for accessing and traversing elements.
- **ConcreteIterator**: Implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal of the aggregate.
- **Aggregate**: Defines the interface for creating an Iterator object.
- **ConcreteAggregate**: Implements the Aggregate interface and provides an implementation for creating an iterator.

## Example
Suppose we have a list of tasks and we want to iterate over them without exposing the internal list structure. We can use the Iterator pattern to achieve this.
